        Notes and planning
        function game() will have 5 rounds
        function getComputerChoice() makes random selection of Rock, Paper, or Scissors
        for user input, use previously written function to convert to correct format
        use a loop to verify appropriate input (loops not yet taught)
        Check input and output requirements from project description:
           1. Each round takes paramenters computerSelection and playerSelection
           2. Returns a string announcing the winner
                Note by me: this doesn't seem like the best thing to return
                   It says I will use this later.
                   Would be more usable to return only the winner name.
                   Sample output "You lose! Paper beats Rock."
        Sample code:
                   function playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection) {
                  // your code here!
                   }
 
                  const playerSelection = "rock";
                  const computerSelection = getComputerChoice();
                  console.log(playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection));
            3. Use prompt() to get input. (sample code uses a test input)
        Overall algorithm for game:
          1. Initialize scores to 0.
          2. Repeat 5 times:
              a. Play a round
              b. Announce choices and winner for round.
              c. Update scores
          3. Announce final scores
        Algorithm for round:
             1. Get computer choice (outside playRound in example)
             2. Get player choice (outside playRound in example)
             3. Check for tie
                 If tie, no change to scores, output tie message
                   If return here, remainder doesn't need to be wrapped in an else
                 If computer choice is rock (if)
                    If my choice is paper
                       I win (update score and output win message)
                    If my choice is scissors
                       I lose (update score and output lose message)
                If computer choice is paper (else if)
                    If my choice is scissors
                       I win (update score and output win message)
                    If my choice is rock
                       I lose (update score and output lose message)
                If computer choice is scissors (doesn't need to be "else" if returned above)
                    If my choice is rock
                       I win (update score and output win message)
                    If my choice is paper
                       I lose (update score and output lose message)
                Return a default message for in-progress results
            Could include winMessage and loseMessage functions
               tie only occurs once -- function not needed
